## Usage

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `renamer.py` script.
3. Run the script using the command `python renamer.py <foldername> <new_name>`.
   - Replace `<foldername>` with the path of the directory containing the files you want to rename.
   - Replace `<new_name>` with the custom name you want to use for renaming the files.
   
Please note that the script will rename all the files in the specified directory with the custom name followed by a unique number.
For example, if you run the command 

> python renamer.py /path/to/directory <space> new_custom_name`

The files will be renamed as `new_custom_name_1`, `new_custom_name_2`, `new_custom_name_3`, and so on.
